## Structure of this Repo

- [/docs](docs/): Contains our governance docs. These define important processes, agreements, structures, models, and workflows. Collectively they are our "governance design".
- [/flows](flows/): Contains our governance change flows. These define how changes to different parts of the governance repo are made. Collectively they are our "meta governance process" (the change management process for our governance design).
