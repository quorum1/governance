### Step 4 - Launch

The moment that the Working Release is merged into the `main` branch is referred to as the **Publish Date** of the Release. After the Publish Date, an additional set of actions must be taken as outlined below.

The Release Point & Steward must sign a document (e-signature is acceptable) which states that they certify that, as of the Publish Date:

1. Quorum1's Financial Model has been updated
