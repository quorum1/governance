b. **Democratic member control.** Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by  their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions.  
c. **Members’ economic participation.** Members contribute to, and democratically control,  the capital of the Organization. Members allocate Organization revenue for the  following purposes: improve and maintain the organizational structure of the  Organization and manage the overall effectiveness of the Organization.  
d. **Autonomy and independence.** The Organization is controlled by its members. If the  Organization enters into agreements with other organizations, including governments, or  raises capital from external sources, the Organization will strive to do so on terms that  ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their cooperative autonomy. 
e. **Education, training, and information.** The Organization will strive to provide  education and training for their members so they can contribute effectively to the  development of the Organization. 
f. **Concern for community.** Cooperatives work for the sustainable development of their  industry through policies approved by their members.

**1.3 Name and Principal Place of Business.** The name of the Organization is QUORUM ONE,  LLC. The Organization shall maintain its principal business office at the following address:  

5758 GEARY BOULEVARD, SUITE 141 
SAN FRANCISCO CA 94121 

**1.4 Agent for Service of Process.** The agent for service of process is REGISTERED  AGENTS INC. 
**1.5 Tax Classification.** The Members intend the Organization to be classified as a C Corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. The financial and accounting  provisions in this Agreement are intended to comply with Subchapter T of the Internal  Revenue Code. 

**SECTION 2** 
**MEMBERSHIP** 
**2.1 Names and Addresses of Members.** The names and addresses of the Members are  attached as Exhibit A and will be updated upon the admission of a new Member. Each  member shall provide the Organization with the information required for each Member in Exhibit A and shall promptly notify the Organization of any change to such information. 
**2.2 Membership Interests and Net Worth of Organization.** Ownership of the Organization shall be reflected in Capital Accounts, as described in Section 7. Each Member shall have a  Capital Account (also referred to in this Agreement as “Member Account”) that reflects the  Member’s equity in the Organization. A Member’s Membership Interest is the Member  Account. The Organization’s Collective Account consists of retained earnings that shall not  be distributed to Members except at dissolution. The sum of the balances of the Capital  Accounts is the net worth of the Organization. 
**2.3 Class of Members.** There shall be one class of Members, which class shall consist of the  Partner Members as defined in the Rules and Regulations of the Organization (the “Rules  and Regulations”), attached hereto as Exhibit “B”. Members shall vote on a one vote per 
person basis on any matter requiring voting by Members at meetings of the Members.  Voting will not be determined by the relative percentage ownership of Members, i.e., if one  Member owns 98% and two members each own 1%, a vote would still require two of the  three Members to make a majority. 
**2.4 Membership Qualifications.** A person seeking Membership in the Organization is a  “Candidate.” A Candidate must meet all the qualifications as set forth for a Partner in the  Rules and Regulations and must sign and agree to be bound by the Organization’s  Operating Agreement, Rules and Regulations, and the Subscription Agreement. 
**2.5 Membership Dues.** Each Member shall be required to make monthly or annual payments  to the Organization as set forth in the Organizations wiki page maintained in accordance  with the Rules and Regulations of the Organization. Should a Member be more than 90  days late with any such Membership dues, such member shall be placed on inactive status  and shall not be entitled to any rights in the Organization, including share of profits, voting  rights, or any other rights provided in this Operating Agreement or the Rules and  Regulations.  
**2.6 Admission of Prospective Members.** All prospective members shall apply via written  application or nomination by a prospective member to the Recruiting Quorum. A Candidate  must meet all of the Membership Qualification for a Partner as set forth in the Rules and  regulations. The application shall be accepted unless rejected in writing within thirty (30)  days for reasons satisfactory to the Organization. If a Candidate is not rejected as a  Member, the Recruiting Quorum shall issue the Candidate a Membership in the  Organization.

**SECTION 3**
**TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP**
**3.1 Termination of Membership.** A Member’s Membership Interest in the Organization shall  terminate by any of the following:

Resignation shall terminate the Member’s Membership Interest in the Organization and  shall be effective immediately upon filing the resignation, or, if later, at the time  specified in the notice. 
  b. **Expulsion.** A Member may be expelled from the Organization for any lawful reason,  including for failure to comply with the Rules and Regulations, standards, or any  written code of conduct of the Organization, or for any other reasonably justifiable  reason, effective immediately, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all Members. Such votes may be cast by any manner as set forth in the Rules and Regulations and do not need to

  c. **Other Causes of Involuntary Withdrawal.** A Member may be terminated involuntarily  under any of the following circumstances: 
  i. The Member dies. A Membership shall immediately terminate upon the death of a  Member. The deceased Member’s designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive  from the Organization the value of the Member’s Member Account and all other  payments due to such Member prior to the death of such Member (the “Death  Benefit”), if and only if, prior to death, the Member filed a Designated Beneficiary  Form with the Organization. The Designated Beneficiary shall be paid the Death  Benefit according to Section 3.2 below, unless the Org Point decides to pay the  Designated Beneficiary on an earlier schedule.  
  ii. A medical professional deems the Member mentally incapable of handling their  own affairs. 
  iii. A guardian or general conservator for the Member is appointed. 
**3.2 Rights Upon Membership Termination.**

Such amount shall be calculated after making all profit and loss  adjustments through the date of termination. No voting, participation, or ownership  rights will survive termination, whether voluntary or involuntary. All economic rights  cease upon payment to the Member or the Designated Beneficiary the amount as  calculated in this section.  
  b. The Organization, in settling a Members’ Capital Account, shall have the right to offset  any and all indebtedness of the Member to the Organization. When a Membership is  terminated, such Member is still responsible for any charges, dues, or other obligations  that the Member owes to the Organization accrued prior to the date of termination. The  Organization shall still have the right to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages  for its breach. If the Organization incurs any costs in enforcing such obligations or  damages, the Member or its heirs or assigns or agents must pay all collection costs.

**11.3 Tax Matters Partner.** The Manager, or such other person or entity designated by the  Manager, shall be the “partnership representative” within the meaning of Code Section  6223(a), as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and under any comparable  provision of any other applicable law (“Partnership Representative”). The Partnership  Representative shall manage audits, after consultation with the Manager, conducted by the  Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority pursuant to the audit procedures  under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or other applicable  law. The Partnership Representative shall give prompt notice to the Manager of any and all  notices it receives from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority 
concerning the Organization (that have not previously been provided by the Internal  Revenue Service or another taxing authority to the Managers directly), including without  limitation, any notice of audit, any notice of action with respect to a revenue agent’s report,  any notice of a thirty (30)-day appeal letter and any notice of a deficiency in tax concerning  the Organization’s income tax return. 
The Partnership Representative shall, at the Organization’s expense, furnish the Manager  with status reports regarding any negotiations between the Internal Revenue Service (or any  other taxing authority) and the Organization, and the Managers, if it so requests, may  participate in any negotiation, meeting or discussion with the Internal Revenue Service (or  other taxing authority). 
The Partnership Representative may, in its reasonable discretion, cause the Organization, to  the extent eligible, to make the election under Section 6221(b) or Section 6226(a) of the Code  and take any other action necessary to effectuate such elections. If, in connection with an  audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Partnership Representative makes an election  under Code Section 6226(a) to treat an imputed underpayment as an adjustment to be taken  in account by each Member, each such Member shall take such adjustment into account as  required under Code Section 6226(b), and shall be liable for any related interest, penalty,  addition to tax, or additional amounts, whether or not such Member then owns any interest  in the Organization. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the  Organization, the Partnership Representative and the other Members from and against such  Member’s respective portion of the financial burden of an imputed underpayment or any  other liability with respect to income attributable to, or distributions or other payments to,  such Member, including any associated interest, adjustments to tax, penalties, and the cost  of contesting any partnership-level adjustment. 
If the Organization is subject to an imputed underpayment with respect to which a Section  6226(a) election has not been made (“Organization Tax Liability”): (i) the Partnership  Representative may cause the Members (including any former Member) to whom such  liability relates, as reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative in its discretion,  to pay, and each such Member hereby agrees to pay, such amount to the Organization and  such amount shall not be treated as a Capital Contribution for purposes of any provision  herein that affects distributions to the Members, (ii) any amount not paid by a Member (or  former Member) at the time reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative shall  accrue interest at the maximum legal rate, compounded quarterly, until paid, and such  Member (or former Member) shall also be liable to the Organization for any damages  resulting from a delay in making such payment beyond the date such payment is reasonably  requested by the Partnership Representative, and for this purpose the fact that the  Organization could have paid this amount with other funds shall not be taken into account in  determining such damages; and (iii) any Member (or former Member) that fails to properly  report or pay its allocable share of any Organization Tax Liability shall indemnify and hold  harmless the Organization against any costs incurred by the Organization as a result of such  Member’s failure. 
If a Member is audited by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, such  Member shall promptly notify the Partnership Representative and the Manages of such audit 
when it concerns any matter involving the Organization. Such Member shall keep the  Partnership Representative and the Manager informed of the status and progress of the audit insofar as it relates to matters pertaining to the Organization, send copies of relevant  documentation to the Partnership Representative and the Manager and give the Organization,  acting through the Partnership Representative or other representative designated by the  Manager, the opportunity to participate (to the extent desired and at the Organization's cost)  in proceedings which might impact on the Organization or other Members.  
Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Partnership Representative in such  capacity as set forth in this Section 11.3 shall be borne by the Organization, and the  Partnership Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless for such expenses. Such  expenses shall include fees for attorneys and other tax professionals, accountants, appraisers  and experts, filing fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. No Member shall file a  notice with the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authority in connection  with such Member’s intention to treat an item on such Member’s federal income tax return  in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the Organization’s federal  income tax return, unless such Member has, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing  of such notice, provided the Partnership Representative with a copy of the notice and  thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information related thereto as the  Partnership Representative shall reasonably request. 
The obligations of each Member (or former Member) under this Section 11.3 may be  enforced by legal process or any other lawful means and shall survive the transfer by such  Member of its interest, the withdrawal or dissociation of such Member, the sale of  Organization assets, and the dissolution, liquidation, and termination of the Organization.  The Member is responsible for all costs of collection under this section, including reasonable  attorney’s fees.  
**11.4 Notices.** All notices required to be given by this Agreement shall be given by one of the  following methods: 1) Notice may be mailed to the physical addresses of the Members, in  which case notice shall be considered given three business days after the notice is place in  the mail with first class postage; 2) Notice may be delivered by email and/or text to the  email addresses and/or phone numbers provided by Members, in which case notice shall be  considered delivered when sent; 3) Notice may be delivered in person, in which case notice  shall be considered delivered when the notice is placed in the hands of the Member. 
**11.5 Amendments to this Agreement.** All amendments to this Agreement shall be in writing  and signed by three-fourths (3/4) of the Members, except that § 7.1.d and § 7.6 regarding  Mandatory Revenue Disbursements may not be amended. The Mandatory Revenue  Disbursements must be included in any and all Organization Operating Agreements,  Organization Rules and Regulations, and Organization Financial Model. The Mandatory  Revenue Disbursements may not be amended or removed from the Operating Agreement,  or any restatements thereof, by the Rules and Regulations, by any action of the OP,  Manager, Director, Officer, Members, or any other person or entity acting alone or  together.

All Members hereby  irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San  Francisco County, California.

Either party may appear at any arbitration hearing, meeting, or other event via  phone or video conference proceedings, so long as all attendees may speak and be heard by  all other attendees. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective  arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any  federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute  relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement,  including, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable or a  particular claim is subject to arbitration.
