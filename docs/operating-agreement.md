The Collective is organized as a limited liability company in accordance  with the California Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the “Act”). 

### 1.2 Purpose and Scope. 

Within the meaning and for purposes of the Act, the purpose and  scope of the Collective shall include any lawful action or activity permitted to a limited  liability company under the Act (the “Business”). 

### 1.3 Name and Principal Place of Business. 

The name of the Collective is Quorum One, LLC. The Collective shall maintain its principal business office at the following address:

> 5758 GEARY BOULEVARD, SUITE 141
> SAN FRANCISCO CA 94121 

### 1.4 Agent for Service of Process.

The agent for service of process is REGISTERED AGENTS INC. 

### 1.5 Tax Classification.

The Stewards intend the Collective to be classified as a C Corporation for federal and state income tax purposes. The financial and accounting  provisions in this Agreement are intended to comply with Subchapter T of the Internal  Revenue Code. 

## SECTION 2 - STEWARDSHIP

### 2.1 Names and Addresses of Stewards. 

The names and addresses of the Stewards are attached as Exhibit A in the hard copy of this document that has been submitted to State, Federal, Tax, and any other regulatory body as part of the compliance of operating a business, and will be updated upon the admission of a new Steward. Each Steward shall provide the Collective with the information required for each Steward in Exhibit A and shall promptly notify the Collective of any change to such information.

### 2.2 Stewardship Interests and Net Worth of Collective.

Ownership of the Collective shall be reflected in Capital Accounts, as described in Section 7. Each Steward shall have a  Capital Account (also referred to in this Agreement as “Steward Account”) that reflects the  Steward’s equity in the Collective. A Steward’s Stewardship Interest is the Steward  Account. The Collective’s Collective Account consists of retained earnings that shall not  be distributed to Stewards except at dissolution. The sum of the balances of the Capital  Accounts is the net worth of the Collective. 

### 2.3 Class of Stewards.

For legal and regulatory purposes, the Collective refers to the "Members" of the LLC as "Stewards". There is only one class of Stewards and it consists of the Steward-level members as defined in the [Rules and Regulations](./rules-and-regs.md) of the Collective (the “Rules  and Regulations”). Stewards shall vote on a one vote per person basis on any matter requiring voting by Stewards at meetings of the Stewards.  Voting will not be determined by the relative percentage ownership of Stewards, i.e., if one  Steward owns 98% and two Stewards each own 1%, a vote would still require two of the  three Stewards to make a majority. 

### 2.4 Stewardship Qualifications.

A person seeking Stewardship in the Collective is a  “Candidate.” A Candidate must meet all the qualifications as set forth for a Steward in the  Rules and Regulations and must sign and agree to be bound by the Collective’s  Operating Agreement, Rules and Regulations, and the Subscription Agreement. 


### 2.5 Stewardship Dues. 

Each Steward shall be required to make monthly or annual payments  to the Collective as set forth in the Rules and Regulations of the Collective. Should a Steward be more than 90  days late with any such Stewardship dues, such Steward shall, at the discretion of the Managing Steward, be placed on inactive status and, if so, shall not be entitled to any rights in the Collective, including share of profits, voting  rights, or any other rights provided in this Operating Agreement or the Rules and  Regulations. 

### 2.6 Admission of Prospective Stewards. 

All prospective Stewards shall apply via written application or nomination by a current Steward. A Candidate must meet all of the Stewardship Qualification for a Steward as set forth in the Rules and Regulations. The application shall be accepted unless rejected in writing within thirty (30)  days for reasons satisfactory to the Collective. If a Candidate is not rejected as a  Steward, the Collective shall issue the Candidate a Stewardship. 

### 2.7 Transfers of Interests.

No Steward shall have the right to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber  or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Steward’s Stewardship Interest. 

## SECTION 3 - TERMINATION OF STEWARDSHIP

### 3.1 Termination of Stewardship.

A Steward’s Stewardship Interest in the Collective shall  terminate by any of the following: 

#### a. Voluntary Withdrawal. 
A Steward may resign from the Collective at any time, with  or without cause, by giving written notice to Management of the Collective.  Resignation shall terminate the Steward’s Stewardship Interest in the Collective and  shall be effective immediately upon filing the resignation, or, if later, at the time  specified in the notice.

#### b. Expulsion. 
A Steward may be expelled from the Collective for any lawful reason,  including for failure to comply with the Rules and Regulations, standards, or any  written code of conduct of the Collective, or for any other reasonably justifiable  reason, effective immediately, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all Stewards. Such votes may be cast by any manner as set forth in the Rules and Regulations and do not need to 
be cast at a meeting of the Stewards. If the Stewards vote to expel the Steward, the  expulsion shall be effective immediately. 

#### c. Other Causes of Involuntary Withdrawal.

A Steward may be expelled involuntarily  under any of the following circumstances:

i. The Steward dies. A Stewardship shall immediately terminate upon the death of a  Steward. The deceased Steward’s designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive  from the Collective the value of the Steward’s Steward Account and all other  payments due to such Steward prior to the death of such Steward (the “Death  Benefit”), if and only if, prior to death, the Steward filed a Designated Beneficiary  Form with the Collective. The Designated Beneficiary shall be paid the Death  Benefit according to Section 3.2 below, unless the Org Point decides to pay the  Designated Beneficiary on an earlier schedule.

ii. A medical professional deems the Steward mentally incapable of handling their  own affairs. 

iii. A guardian or general conservator for the Steward is appointed. 

### 3.2 Rights Upon Stewardship Termination  

1. When a Stewardship is terminated, voluntarily or involuntarily, the amount in such  Steward’s Capital Account will be paid to the Steward or if the Steward is deceased, to  the Steward’s Designated Beneficiary within ninety (90) days of written notice received  by Collective from the Steward or the Designated Beneficiary regarding the  terminated Steward. Such amount shall be calculated after making all profit and loss  adjustments through the date of termination. No voting, participation, or ownership  rights will survive termination, whether voluntary or involuntary. All economic rights  cease upon payment to the Steward or the Designated Beneficiary the amount as  calculated in this section.

2. The Collective, in settling a Stewards’ Capital Account, shall have the right to offset  any and all indebtedness of the Steward to the Collective. When a Stewardship is  terminated, such Steward is still responsible for any charges, dues, or other obligations  that the Steward owes to the Collective accrued prior to the date of termination. The Collective shall still have the right to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages  for its breach. If the Collective incurs any costs in enforcing such obligations or  damages, the Steward or its heirs or assigns or agents must pay all collection costs.

### 11.3 Tax Matters Partner. 
The Manager, or such other person or entity designated by the  Manager, shall be the “partnership representative” within the meaning of Code Section  6223(a), as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and under any comparable  provision of any other applicable law (“Partnership Representative”). The Partnership  Representative shall manage audits, after consultation with the Manager, conducted by the  Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority pursuant to the audit procedures  under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or other applicable  law. The Partnership Representative shall give prompt notice to the Manager of any and all  notices it receives from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority 
concerning the Collective (that have not previously been provided by the Internal  Revenue Service or another taxing authority to the Managers directly), including without  limitation, any notice of audit, any notice of action with respect to a revenue agent’s report,  any notice of a thirty (30)-day appeal letter and any notice of a deficiency in tax concerning  the Collective’s income tax return. 

The Partnership Representative shall, at the Collective’s expense, furnish the Manager  with status reports regarding any negotiations between the Internal Revenue Service (or any  other taxing authority) and the Collective, and the Managers, if it so requests, may  participate in any negotiation, meeting or discussion with the Internal Revenue Service (or  other taxing authority). 

The Partnership Representative may, in its reasonable discretion, cause the Collective, to  the extent eligible, to make the election under Section 6221(b) or Section 6226(a) of the Code  and take any other action necessary to effectuate such elections. If, in connection with an  audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Partnership Representative makes an election  under Code Section 6226(a) to treat an imputed underpayment as an adjustment to be taken  in account by each Steward, each such Steward shall take such adjustment into account as  required under Code Section 6226(b), and shall be liable for any related interest, penalty,  addition to tax, or additional amounts, whether or not such Steward then owns any interest  in the Collective. Each Steward hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Collective, the Partnership Representative and the other Stewards from and against such  Steward’s respective portion of the financial burden of an imputed underpayment or any  other liability with respect to income attributable to, or distributions or other payments to,  such Steward, including any associated interest, adjustments to tax, penalties, and the cost  of contesting any partnership-level adjustment. 

If the Collective is subject to an imputed underpayment with respect to which a Section  6226(a) election has not been made (“Collective Tax Liability”): (i) the Partnership  Representative may cause the Stewards (including any former Steward) to whom such  liability relates, as reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative in its discretion,  to pay, and each such Steward hereby agrees to pay, such amount to the Collective and  such amount shall not be treated as a Capital Contribution for purposes of any provision  herein that affects distributions to the Stewards, (ii) any amount not paid by a Steward (or  former Steward) at the time reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative shall  accrue interest at the maximum legal rate, compounded quarterly, until paid, and such  Steward (or former Steward) shall also be liable to the Collective for any damages  resulting from a delay in making such payment beyond the date such payment is reasonably  requested by the Partnership Representative, and for this purpose the fact that the Collective could have paid this amount with other funds shall not be taken into account in  determining such damages; and (iii) any Steward (or former Steward) that fails to properly  report or pay its allocable share of any Collective Tax Liability shall indemnify and hold  harmless the Collective against any costs incurred by the Collective as a result of such  Steward’s failure. 

If a Steward is audited by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, such  Steward shall promptly notify the Partnership Representative and the Manages of such audit when it concerns any matter involving the Collective. Such Steward shall keep the  Partnership Representative and the Manager informed of the status and progress of the audit insofar as it relates to matters pertaining to the Collective, send copies of relevant  documentation to the Partnership Representative and the Manager and give the Collective,  acting through the Partnership Representative or other representative designated by the  Manager, the opportunity to participate (to the extent desired and at the Collective's cost)  in proceedings which might impact on the Collective or other Stewards. 

Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Partnership Representative in such  capacity as set forth in this Section 11.3 shall be borne by the Collective, and the  Partnership Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless for such expenses. Such  expenses shall include fees for attorneys and other tax professionals, accountants, appraisers  and experts, filing fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. No Steward shall file a  notice with the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authority in connection  with such Steward’s intention to treat an item on such Steward’s federal income tax return  in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the Collective’s federal  income tax return, unless such Steward has, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing  of such notice, provided the Partnership Representative with a copy of the notice and  thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information related thereto as the  Partnership Representative shall reasonably request. 

The obligations of each Steward (or former Steward) under this Section 11.3 may be  enforced by legal process or any other lawful means and shall survive the transfer by such  Steward of its interest, the withdrawal or dissociation of such Steward, the sale of  Collective assets, and the dissolution, liquidation, and termination of the Collective.  The Steward is responsible for all costs of collection under this section, including reasonable  attorney’s fees. 

### 11.4 Notices. 
All notices required to be given by this Agreement shall be given by one of the  following methods: 1) Notice may be mailed to the physical addresses of the Stewards, in  which case notice shall be considered given three business days after the notice is place in  the mail with first class postage; 2) Notice may be delivered by email and/or text to the  email addresses and/or phone numbers provided by Stewards, in which case notice shall be  considered delivered when sent; 3) Notice may be delivered in person, in which case notice  shall be considered delivered when the notice is placed in the hands of the Steward. 
### 11.5 Amendments to this Agreement. 
All amendments to this Agreement shall be in writing  and signed by three-fourths (3/4) of the Stewards, except that § 7.1.d and § 7.6 regarding  Mandatory Revenue Disbursements may not be amended. The Mandatory Revenue  Disbursements must be included in any and all Collective Operating Agreements,  Collective Rules and Regulations, and Collective Financial Model. The Mandatory  Revenue Disbursements may not be amended or removed from the Operating Agreement,  or any restatements thereof, by the Rules and Regulations, by any action of the OP,  Manager, Director, Officer, Stewards, or any other person or entity acting alone or  together. 
### 11.6 Entire Agreement. 
This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties and  supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral negotiations, correspondence,  understandings and agreements between and among the parties, regarding the subject  matter addressed in this Agreement.  
### 11.7 Binding on Successors. 
This Agreement and the terms and conditions contained in this  Agreement apply to and are binding upon the Steward's successors, assigns, executors,  administrators, beneficiaries, and representatives. 
### 11.8 Severability. 
If a provision of this Agreement is held by a court to be invalid or  unenforceable, Stewards agree that the provision shall be reduced in scope by the court  only to the extent deemed necessary by that court to render the provision reasonable and  enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected or  invalidated as a result. 
### 11.9 Counterparts. 
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be  deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same  agreement. Facsimile or other electronic signatures shall be considered original signatures. 
A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email, or other means of  electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an  original signed copy of this Agreement. 
### 11.10 Waiver. 
No delay or failure on the part of any Steward to exercise any right or power  arising hereunder will act as a waiver of such right. 
### 11.11 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the  State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. All Stewards hereby  irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San  Francisco County, California.  
### 11.12 Arbitration. 
If informal mediation is not successful, any action to enforce or interpret this  Agreement or to resolve disputes between the Collective and its Stewards shall be  settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Arbitration shall be the exclusive dispute resolution process in San Francisco, California.  Any party may commence arbitration by sending a written demand for arbitration to the  other party. Either party may appear at any arbitration hearing, meeting, or other event via  phone or video conference proceedings, so long as all attendees may speak and be heard by  all other attendees. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective  arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any  federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute  relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement,  including, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable or a  particular claim is subject to arbitration. The parties shall share equally all initial costs of  arbitration. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of attorney fees, costs, 
and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered  by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
### 11.13 Survival. 
The rights and obligations of the parties which by their nature must survive  termination or expiration of this Agreement in order to achieve its fundamental purposes  including, without limitation, the provisions regarding payment of Profit Share,  confidentiality, indemnity, limitation of liability, and miscellaneous, shall survive any  termination of this Agreement.
