### 11.3 Tax Matters Partner. 
The Manager, or such other person or entity designated by the  Manager, shall be the “partnership representative” within the meaning of Code Section  6223(a), as enacted by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and under any comparable  provision of any other applicable law (“Partnership Representative”). The Partnership  Representative shall manage audits, after consultation with the Manager, conducted by the  Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority pursuant to the audit procedures  under the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or other applicable  law. The Partnership Representative shall give prompt notice to the Manager of any and all  notices it receives from the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority 
concerning the Organization (that have not previously been provided by the Internal  Revenue Service or another taxing authority to the Managers directly), including without  limitation, any notice of audit, any notice of action with respect to a revenue agent’s report,  any notice of a thirty (30)-day appeal letter and any notice of a deficiency in tax concerning  the Organization’s income tax return. 

The Partnership Representative shall, at the Organization’s expense, furnish the Manager  with status reports regarding any negotiations between the Internal Revenue Service (or any  other taxing authority) and the Organization, and the Managers, if it so requests, may  participate in any negotiation, meeting or discussion with the Internal Revenue Service (or  other taxing authority). 

The Partnership Representative may, in its reasonable discretion, cause the Organization, to  the extent eligible, to make the election under Section 6221(b) or Section 6226(a) of the Code  and take any other action necessary to effectuate such elections. If, in connection with an  audit by the Internal Revenue Service, the Partnership Representative makes an election  under Code Section 6226(a) to treat an imputed underpayment as an adjustment to be taken  in account by each Member, each such Member shall take such adjustment into account as  required under Code Section 6226(b), and shall be liable for any related interest, penalty,  addition to tax, or additional amounts, whether or not such Member then owns any interest  in the Organization. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the  Organization, the Partnership Representative and the other Members from and against such  Member’s respective portion of the financial burden of an imputed underpayment or any  other liability with respect to income attributable to, or distributions or other payments to,  such Member, including any associated interest, adjustments to tax, penalties, and the cost  of contesting any partnership-level adjustment. 

If the Organization is subject to an imputed underpayment with respect to which a Section  6226(a) election has not been made (“Organization Tax Liability”): (i) the Partnership  Representative may cause the Members (including any former Member) to whom such  liability relates, as reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative in its discretion,  to pay, and each such Member hereby agrees to pay, such amount to the Organization and  such amount shall not be treated as a Capital Contribution for purposes of any provision  herein that affects distributions to the Members, (ii) any amount not paid by a Member (or  former Member) at the time reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative shall  accrue interest at the maximum legal rate, compounded quarterly, until paid, and such  Member (or former Member) shall also be liable to the Organization for any damages  resulting from a delay in making such payment beyond the date such payment is reasonably  requested by the Partnership Representative, and for this purpose the fact that the  Organization could have paid this amount with other funds shall not be taken into account in  determining such damages; and (iii) any Member (or former Member) that fails to properly  report or pay its allocable share of any Organization Tax Liability shall indemnify and hold  harmless the Organization against any costs incurred by the Organization as a result of such  Member’s failure. 

If a Member is audited by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, such  Member shall promptly notify the Partnership Representative and the Manages of such audit when it concerns any matter involving the Organization. Such Member shall keep the  Partnership Representative and the Manager informed of the status and progress of the audit insofar as it relates to matters pertaining to the Organization, send copies of relevant  documentation to the Partnership Representative and the Manager and give the Organization,  acting through the Partnership Representative or other representative designated by the  Manager, the opportunity to participate (to the extent desired and at the Organization's cost)  in proceedings which might impact on the Organization or other Members. 

Expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the Partnership Representative in such  capacity as set forth in this Section 11.3 shall be borne by the Organization, and the  Partnership Representative shall be indemnified and held harmless for such expenses. Such  expenses shall include fees for attorneys and other tax professionals, accountants, appraisers  and experts, filing fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. No Member shall file a  notice with the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable taxing authority in connection  with such Member’s intention to treat an item on such Member’s federal income tax return  in a manner that is inconsistent with the treatment of such item on the Organization’s federal  income tax return, unless such Member has, not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing  of such notice, provided the Partnership Representative with a copy of the notice and  thereafter in a timely manner provides such other information related thereto as the  Partnership Representative shall reasonably request. 

The obligations of each Member (or former Member) under this Section 11.3 may be  enforced by legal process or any other lawful means and shall survive the transfer by such  Member of its interest, the withdrawal or dissociation of such Member, the sale of  Organization assets, and the dissolution, liquidation, and termination of the Organization.  The Member is responsible for all costs of collection under this section, including reasonable  attorney’s fees. 

### 11.4 Notices. 
All notices required to be given by this Agreement shall be given by one of the  following methods: 1) Notice may be mailed to the physical addresses of the Members, in  which case notice shall be considered given three business days after the notice is place in  the mail with first class postage; 2) Notice may be delivered by email and/or text to the  email addresses and/or phone numbers provided by Members, in which case notice shall be  considered delivered when sent; 3) Notice may be delivered in person, in which case notice  shall be considered delivered when the notice is placed in the hands of the Member. 
### 11.5 Amendments to this Agreement. 
All amendments to this Agreement shall be in writing  and signed by three-fourths (3/4) of the Members, except that § 7.1.d and § 7.6 regarding  Mandatory Revenue Disbursements may not be amended. The Mandatory Revenue  Disbursements must be included in any and all Organization Operating Agreements,  Organization Rules and Regulations, and Organization Financial Model. The Mandatory  Revenue Disbursements may not be amended or removed from the Operating Agreement,  or any restatements thereof, by the Rules and Regulations, by any action of the OP,  Manager, Director, Officer, Members, or any other person or entity acting alone or  together. 
### 11.6 Entire Agreement. 
This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the parties and  supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral negotiations, correspondence,  understandings and agreements between and among the parties, regarding the subject  matter addressed in this Agreement.

This Agreement and the terms and conditions contained in this  Agreement apply to and are binding upon the Member's successors, assigns, executors,  administrators, beneficiaries, and representatives. 
### 11.8 Severability. 
If a provision of this Agreement is held by a court to be invalid or  unenforceable, Members agree that the provision shall be reduced in scope by the court  only to the extent deemed necessary by that court to render the provision reasonable and  enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected or  invalidated as a result. 
### 11.9 Counterparts. 
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be  deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same  agreement. Facsimile or other electronic signatures shall be considered original signatures. 
A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile, email, or other means of  electronic transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an  original signed copy of this Agreement. 
### 11.10 Waiver. 
No delay or failure on the part of any Member to exercise any right or power  arising hereunder will act as a waiver of such right. 
### 11.11 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the  State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions. All Members hereby  irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San  Francisco County, California.  
### 11.12 Arbitration. 
If informal mediation is not successful, any action to enforce or interpret this  Agreement or to resolve disputes between the Organization and its Members shall be  settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Arbitration shall be the exclusive dispute resolution process in San Francisco, California.  Any party may commence arbitration by sending a written demand for arbitration to the  other party. Either party may appear at any arbitration hearing, meeting, or other event via  phone or video conference proceedings, so long as all attendees may speak and be heard by  all other attendees. The arbitrator shall not conduct any form of class or collective  arbitration nor join or consolidate claims by or for individuals. The arbitrator, and not any  federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute  relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement,  including, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable or a  particular claim is subject to arbitration. The parties shall share equally all initial costs of  arbitration. The prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of attorney fees, costs, 
and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered  by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
### 11.13 Survival.
