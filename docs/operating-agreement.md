The names and addresses of the Members are attached as Exhibit A in the hard copy of this document that has been submitted to State, Federal, Tax, and any other regulatory body as part of the compliance of operating a business, and will be updated upon the admission of a new Member. Each  member shall provide the Organization with the information required for each Member in Exhibit A and shall promptly notify the Organization of any change to such information.

**2.2 Membership Interests and Net Worth of Organization.**

Ownership of the Organization shall be reflected in Capital Accounts, as described in Section 7. Each Member shall have a  Capital Account (also referred to in this Agreement as “Member Account”) that reflects the  Member’s equity in the Organization. A Member’s Membership Interest is the Member  Account. The Organization’s Collective Account consists of retained earnings that shall not  be distributed to Members except at dissolution. The sum of the balances of the Capital  Accounts is the net worth of the Organization. 

**2.3 Class of Members.**

There shall be one class of Members, which class shall consist of the Steward Members as defined in the [Rules and Regulations](https://github.com/quorum1/governance/blob/release-4/docs/rules-and-regs.md) of the Organization (the “Rules  and Regulations”). Members shall vote on a one vote per person basis on any matter requiring voting by Members at meetings of the Members.  Voting will not be determined by the relative percentage ownership of Members, i.e., if one  Member owns 98% and two members each own 1%, a vote would still require two of the  three Members to make a majority. 

**2.4 Membership Qualifications.**

A person seeking Membership in the Organization is a  “Candidate.” A Candidate must meet all the qualifications as set forth for a Steward in the  Rules and Regulations and must sign and agree to be bound by the Organization’s  Operating Agreement, Rules and Regulations, and the Subscription Agreement.

**2.6 Admission of Prospective Members.** 

All prospective members shall apply via written application or nomination by a current Steward member. A Candidate must meet all of the Membership Qualification for a Steward as set forth in the Rules and Regulations.

Such votes may be cast by any manner as set forth in the Rules and Regulations and do not need to

3. **Other Causes of Involuntary Withdrawal.** A Member may be terminated involuntarily  under any of the following circumstances:

The deceased Member’s designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive  from the Organization the value of the Member’s Member Account and all other  payments due to such Member prior to the death of such Member (the “Death  Benefit”), if and only if, prior to death, the Member filed a Designated Beneficiary  Form with the Organization. The Designated Beneficiary shall be paid the Death  Benefit according to Section 3.2 below, unless the Org Point decides to pay the  Designated Beneficiary on an earlier schedule.

  - ii. A medical professional deems the Member mentally incapable of handling their  own affairs. 
  - iii. A guardian or general conservator for the Member is appointed. 

**3.2 Rights Upon Membership Termination**.  

1.

Such amount shall be calculated after making all profit and loss  adjustments through the date of termination. No voting, participation, or ownership  rights will survive termination, whether voluntary or involuntary. All economic rights  cease upon payment to the Member or the Designated Beneficiary the amount as  calculated in this section.

2. The Organization, in settling a Members’ Capital Account, shall have the right to offset  any and all indebtedness of the Member to the Organization.

If the Organization incurs any costs in enforcing such obligations or  damages, the Member or its heirs or assigns or agents must pay all collection costs.
