# Quorum1 Member Code of Conduct
*The following Code of Conduct (the “Code”) applies to all Quorum One (commonly referred to as “Quorum1”) members, subcontractors, and consultants.*

### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS CODE? 
This Code articulates a set of core commitments each Quorum1 member and Quorum1’s affiliates should uphold to do right for our clients and community. This document should empower you to do your best work and highlight areas of concern to be mindful of when conducting business.

We all have the tools to make good decisions and it is the responsibility of each Quorum1 member to uphold the standards outlined here.

### WHERE DO I GO WITH QUESTIONS?
If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about this Code, please reach out to the Stewards via team@quorum.one or other available channels.

### GOOD FAITH REPORTING AND NON-RETALIATION
Acting in good faith means that all reports of possible violations of this Code, company policy, or the law are made sincerely and honestly. In other words, it does not matter whether your report turns out to be true, but you must make it with the best intentions.

In return, Quorum1 strictly prohibits retaliatory action against anyone who, in good faith, reports a potential violation or who assists in an investigation of a possible violation.

Please contact a representative of the Quorum1 Legal Team at legal@quorum.one if you are worried about becoming or believe you are the subject of any such retaliation.

## The Code of Conduct
This section lays out the set of core commitments that define our culture and should therefore guide your conduct at Quorum1. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

### I. Follow and Comply with the Law
While the law does not solely determine what actions are right and wrong, we are committed to following the law in the jurisdictions in which we operate. At Quorum1, we take our responsibility to comply with laws and regulations seriously. We must follow applicable laws, rules, and regulations at all times. We don’t expect everyone to know every aspect of every applicable law, each of us should understand the major laws and regulations that apply to our work and know when to ask for help.

Each member of Quorum1 should develop their own sense of what to look out for; the items listed here are some areas of particular concern, but our commitment to comply with the law applies across the board.

#### Territory Restrictions

In connection to following and complying with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, Quorum1 members should also be mindful of the list of embargoed or restricted countries in the United States, similar laws and regulations of other countries, and restrictions related to Quorum1 partners and affiliates that restrict the sale of goods and services to certain territories. 

At this moment, regardless of classification, the list of restricted areas include: Crimea, Luhansk or Donetsk regions, Republic of Cuba, Islamic Republic of Iran, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the Syrian Arab Republic.

Quorum1 wants to be clear that it encourages humanitarian efforts and by no means intends to restrict our members’ efforts to help those in need. If you have questions or concerns related to the restrictions listed above in relation to humanitarian efforts, please contact the Stewards via team@quorum.one or other available channels.

### II. Respect Our Clients and Partners

#### A. Protect Assets and Confidential Information

Our clients and partners welcome us into trusted positions and grant us the privilege of partnering with them. We are committed to treating our clients and partners with the utmost respect and keeping their physical and information assets secure.

#### B.  Follow Clients and Partners Rules and Regulations

We are also committed to following our clients’ and partners’ rules and regulations and using our talent, skills, and resources to support them in the fulfillment of their missions.

#### C.  	Resolve Conflicts Constructively

If situations arise where our values appear to be different from those of an existing or prospective client or partner, we will raise the issues in a constructive and timely way. Where appropriate, we will also provide avenues for addressing issues and concerns with broader groups of Quorum1 members.

If we cannot reconcile differences between our work with a client or partner and the values described in this Code, then we are willing to modify, limit, or discontinue the relationship.

### III. Maintain a Safe and Productive Environment

Operating by these values requires us to create and maintain a productive working environment. Consequently, we take care of each other, and we are proud of our work, our people, and our accomplishments. At Quorum1, we don’t put our own personal interests before those of the company, our co-workers, or our clients or partners.

#### A.   Cultivate a Safe Workplace

Quorum1 is committed to a supportive work environment that enables us to reach our full potential. We maintain a culture that eliminates harassment, intimidation, bias, and discrimination. Quorum1 prohibits harassment of all kinds, whether verbal, physical, or by other means, and requires that:
  1. Anyone at Quorum1 who learns of any incident of possible discrimination or harassment should immediately report it to a Steward.
  2. It is the responsibility of everyone at Quorum1 to conscientiously follow this policy.
  3. Quorum1 will fully investigate any incident of harassment and take appropriate corrective actions.

Quorum1 does not tolerate any violence or threats of violence in the workplace. Verbal, online, and physical intimidation are strictly prohibited.

The Stewards will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim and take appropriate action where we find a claim has merit. To the extent possible, we will retain the confidentiality of those who report suspected or alleged violations of the harassment policy. Discipline for violation of this policy may include, but is not limited to, reprimand, suspension, or a membership ban. If the company determines that harassment or discrimination occurred, corrective action will be taken to effectively end the harassment. As necessary, Quorum1 may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to assure the inappropriate behavior has stopped.

Unlawful retaliation can be any action that could discourage someone from coming forward to make or support a discrimination or harassment claim. Adverse action need not be job-related or occur in the workplace to constitute unlawful retaliation (for example, threats of physical violence outside of work hours).

Quorum1 prohibits retaliation against anyone who engages in "protected activity," which occurs when they have:
  - Filed a formal complaint of discrimination or harassment either internally with the company or  externally with an administrative agency or a court of law
  - Testified or assisted in an administrative or court proceeding involving discrimination or harassment.
  - Opposed discrimination or harassment by making a verbal or informal complaint to management or by informing a Steward of harassment.
   - Complained that another employee, members, or contractor has been harassed/discriminated against; or encouraged a fellow employee, member, or contractor to report harassment or discrimination.

Quorum1's anti-retaliation provision is not intended to protect persons making intentionally false charges of discrimination or harassment.

#### B.   Respect Diversity and Combat Bias

We recognize that our individual perspectives are limited by life experiences and (often) a degree of privilege. Consequently, we are committed to building as diverse a community as possible and fostering open and safe communication within that community to create meaningful connection and an inclusive environment at Quorum1.

Biases (both conscious and unconscious) can influence our decision-making abilities and lead to harmful outcomes for Quorum1, ourselves, and others. The best idea wins at Quorum1. We believe that personal biases can prevent us from accurately evaluating an idea on its merit, so we must seek to understand and overcome our biases, which we plan to provide training around for employees, members, and contractors.

#### C.   Promote Equal Opportunities
At Quorum1, we seek to recruit and retain a diverse pool of members. Having a diverse set of viewpoints is the best way to avoid groupthink and stasis.

Quorum1 is an equal opportunity employer. Members and employees of the Quorum1 team are entitled to equal opportunity in the workplace without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.

Quorum1 will make all reasonable accommodations for disabled members and employees to meet and where possible exceed our obligations under laws protecting the rights of the disabled.

#### D.   Communicate Responsibly
While we encourage constructive criticism and feedback, Quorum1 prohibits written or verbal derogatory remarks about colleagues, partners, clients, or other third parties.

### IV. Avoid Conflicts of Interest
Conflicts of interest occur when personal interests interfere with the best interests of Quorum1. We are obligated to do what’s best for Quorum1 and for our clients and partners. At Quorum1, we seek to avoid situations that create even the appearance of a conflict of interest. When we perceive a real or potential conflict of interest, it is essential to discuss the situation with the Stewards before proceeding.

#### A.   Learn How to Spot Potential Conflicts of Interest
In our work, we may face circumstances where competing loyalties present a motivation to pursue benefits for ourselves or for others, like friends or family, at the expense of Quorum1 or our clients or partners. The following questions can help identify if there is a potential conflict of interest present:

  1. If the public knew about this relationship or situation, would Quorum1 be harmed?
  2. If a Steward or others at Quorum1 knew about this relationship or situation, would it reflect badly upon me?
  3. Does this relationship or situation make it difficult for me to do objective and effective work within or leading projects for the Foundation in Quorum1?
  4. Does this relationship or situation require me to act in a way contrary to the values stated in this Code?

#### B.   Avoid Conflicts in Personal Investments
Conflicts of interest can arise when a member or employee has a significant personal investment in a client, supplier, partner, or competitor of Quorum1 that affects their work with Foundation projects. If the investment is in a direct competitor to Quorum1, a conflict of interest exists. If the investment is in a client, supplier, or partner of Quorum1, and the member or employee could take action that benefits his or her investment at the expense of a Quorum1 Foundation project, a conflict of interest exists.

We understand that as Quorum1 grows, the number of clients and competitors increases. If a potential investment seems like it might cause a conflict of interest, it is important to vet the investment as appropriate, to mitigate, if possible, any conflict of interest in conjunction with the Stewards, and to avoid the investment if necessary.

#### C.  	Avoid Conflicts in Personal Relationships
**If a relative, significant other, or close friend is a client, supplier, partner, or competitor of Quorum1, a conflict of interest could arise. In these cases, members should work with the Stewards to make sure no problems arise.**

Quorum1 encourages close bonds between colleagues and understands that some dating relationships are bound to result. If these relationships create a conflict of interest within a Quorum1 Foundation project, changes to the work relationship between the couple may be necessary.

#### D.   Avoid Conflicts in Pursuing Outside Opportunities
Business opportunities that arise in the course of work within a project within Quorum1 are subject to the ownership and IP guidlines defined by that project. 

Quorum1 Foundation projects require a higher level of trust and transparency within the network.  Employment with a client, supplier, partner, or competitor of Quorum1, even if as a consultant or advisor or in an unpaid role, may sometimes create a conflict of interest. Members are allowed to take jobs with and maintain personal business relationships with direct competitors of Quorum1, but they must communicate these relationships to a Steward.

#### E.   Avoid Conflicts in Receiving Gifts and Entertainment
Quorum1 prohibits members from accepting significant gifts from client, suppliers, partners, or competitors. Meals and entertainment can be appropriate parts of business relationships. Larger gifts (valued at $150 or more), however, can create the appearance (or reality) of a conflict of interest, and cannot be accepted without approval from a Steward. Cash or equivalent gifts are prohibited.  If you are unsure whether you can accept a specific gift, please consult a Steward.

### V. Anti-Corruption, Bribery, and Kickbacks

#### Bribery and Kickbacks
Never resort to bribery, facilitation payments, kickbacks, or corrupt practices.
Bribery is offering or giving anything of value in order to improperly influence the recipient’s actions. Examples can include cash, cash equivalents, gifts, entertainment, travel, lodging, charitable contributions, and offers of employment. Bribery is illegal in every jurisdiction in which Quorum1 does business; its consequences are severe, including jail sentences.

A facilitation payment is a tip or small payment made to a government official in order to expedite a routine government action, such as issuing a permit or providing utility service. This is illegal in most jurisdictions and not allowed under the Global Anti-Corruption Policy.

A kickback is the return of a sum paid (or due to be paid) as a reward for fostering a business arrangement. Accepting or offering a kickback violates this Code.

#### Relationships with government officials
If you interact with government officials on Quorum1’s behalf, be particularly careful about gifts, meals, and entertainment. Laws and regulations governing what companies can give government officials are very strict, including in the U.S. Contact the Stewards for approval before offering or providing any gifts, meals, or entertainment to government officials. All interactions with government officials that are not sales-related should involve the Stewards.

A government official can be a national or local government employee, a political candidate, a party official, a member of a royal family, or an employee of a government-controlled entity, such as a state-owned enterprise. 

### VI. Act with Integrity

#### A.   Balance Freedom and Responsibility
Quorum1 gives us a great degree of freedom to work. In exchange, we must exercise responsibility and good judgment in what we do with this freedom. This requires that we act with the utmost integrity in our interactions with each other, with our clients, partners, and with the world at large. Questions can be referred to the Stewards.

#### B.   Maintain and Promote Financial Integrity

##### Conduct Open and Honest Accounting
Financial integrity goes beyond accurate reporting; everyone at Quorum1 must help to ensure that our funds are spent appropriately, that our records are complete and correct, and that our internal policies are followed.

##### Spend Wisely
Requests for reimbursements or expenditures on Quorum1’s behalf must be reasonable, directly related to Quorum1’s mission, and appropriately documented. Members must keep track of the business purpose and submit any required forms on time.

##### Follow Contracts Processes
All vendor and supplier relationships require a signed contract. Only authorized signatories may sign any contract on behalf of Quorum1.

#### C.   Maintain Confidentiality

##### Protect Information
It is our responsibility to make sure that confidential information stays confidential. Unless explicitly authorized, do not disclose confidential information outside of Quorum1. If authorized to disclose, we must still be careful and distribute confidential information only on a “need to know” basis and under a valid Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Please review the applicable confidential information language in your existing employment agreement and reach out to the Stewards if you have any questions. 

##### Earn the Trust of our Clients and Partners
We absolutely must safeguard the confidential information entrusted to us by our clients and partners. We should strive to ensure that appropriate legal agreements are in place before accepting confidential information from other companies.

##### Respect Competitors and Former Members
Quorum1 respects competing companies. We want to compete fairly, and so we categorically will not take advantage of confidential information belonging to a competitor or to the former employer of a fellow member.

##### “Protected Activities” Aren’t Prohibited
Nothing in this Code limits or prohibits members from engaging for a lawful purpose in any “Protected Activity,” which means filing a charge or complaint, or otherwise communicating, cooperating, or participating, with any state, federal or other governmental agency with jurisdiction over Quorum1, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board. Notwithstanding any other policies in this Code (or elsewhere), members don’t have to obtain authorization from Quorum1 before lawfully disclosing information to, or communicating with, such agencies, and members also do not need to advise Quorum1 as to any such disclosures or communications. But, in making any such disclosures or communications, members must take all reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure of any information that may constitute Quorum1 confidential information to anyone other than the relevant government agencies. Protected Activities don’t include the disclosure of any Company attorney-client privileged communications; any disclosure of this kind without Quorum1’s written consent is a violation of Quorum1’s policy.

#### D.   Protect our Assets
Quorum1 respects the intellectual property rights of others and follows all requirements of open source licenses. Unauthorized use of intellectual property belonging to others could lead to criminal and civil penalties against you and Quorum1.

##### Maintain Network Security
Quorum1’s network and network-connected hardware must be protected from any potential attack, and negligent exposure. We must follow all network security policies and always maintain close awareness of our devices, including in transit. Any concerns or suspicions that our network security has been breached, whether by hacking, loss of a laptop or phone, or having a password compromised, should be reported immediately to Team Ops or a Steward.

##### Protect Internal Personal Data
Quorum1 collects and stores personal information for all members, but this data is kept secure, and access is restricted in accordance with internal policy and applicable laws. We must ensure that we treat the personal data of our members, visitors, contractors, and any other personal data under our direct control with the same care for privacy and security that we maintain for our clients’ and partners’ data.

##### No Criminal Acts
Immediately notify Quorum1’s Legal Quorum of any new investigations, especially those related to fraud, misrepresentations, bribery, corruption, tax evasion, sanctions violations, or similar activities which you may be part of or that you learn in connection to another member. These reports should be made directly to the Legal Quorum via legal@quorum.one.

Thank you for reading and following this Code and please don’t hesitate to reach out to the Stewards as mentioned in the beginning of this document if there are any questions, comments or concerns.
