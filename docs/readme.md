# Quorum1 Governance Docs

Each file in this folder defines a governance doc ("doc" for short). Docs can contain any type of information which is key to Quorum1's governance and which is important to manage with our highest level of rigor and transparency. These define important processes, agreements, structures, models, and workflows. Collectively they are our "governance design".

It's important to note that not all governance-related information should necessarily be housed in the governance repo. Some parts of our structure & process may need to be changed with a frequency and an agility which will be difficult to achieve in this repo. In those cases, other repos may be created with more fluid change management processes or things may be stored outside of a repo altogether.

## Making Changes to Docs

Any time a change is made to the governance repo it must be in compliance with all applicable flows, based on the scopes defined in the flows section of the governance repo: [/flows](../flows/).

Any changes which are later determined to have been made out of compliance with one or more of the in-scope flows as defined at the time of the change will be considered invalid and must be re-processed in accordance with the currently in-scope flows.
