These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of all Quorum1 services, including but not limited to the Q1 Network (“the Network”), applications, and tools (“Services”) provided by Quorum1 One, LLC, a democratically managed, member-owned collective incorporated in California (“the Collective,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). 

By accessing or using any of our Services, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Services.

These Terms incorporate our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) and [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md), as well as any additional agreements governing specific tools or features, which together form the complete agreement between you and the Collective.

This document is a living agreement that embodies the principles and shared goals of the Quorum1 community.

## **Section 5: Intellectual Property (IP)**

The Collective takes intellectual property rights seriously and provides clear guidelines to ensure fair and transparent management of IP within the platform.

### **Section 5.1: Member Contributions**

Quorum1 operates as an IP-neutral platform. By default, intellectual property (IP) created within Projects is collectively owned or governed by the terms established at the outset of each Project. You agree to honor these terms and transparently document any changes with all involved parties.

The Collective is not responsible for resolving disputes regarding compensation unless explicitly stated in the governing agreement.

## **Section 8: Third-Party Applications**

The Services may integrate or interact with third-party applications, such as Slack, Notion, or other tools. Your use of these third-party tools is subject to their respective terms and policies. The Collective is not liable for issues or disputes arising from your use of third-party applications.

## **Section 9: Disputes and Limitations**

In the event of disputes or other issues, the Collective offers a structured approach to conflict resolution and sets boundaries to minimize liability.
