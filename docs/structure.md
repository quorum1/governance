# Quorum1 Structure

This doc defines core aspects of Quorum1’s structure.

## Overview

The relationship between the various parts of Quorum1 can be expressed thusly: 

- The Foundation manages and improves the Platform.
- The Org runs on top of the Platform and manages the Foundation.
- Hosted Entities also run on top of the Platform and contribute to the Org and Foundation.

## The Org

The Org is the entirety of Quorum1, including all members, and aspires to be democratic, poly-centric, and non-hierarchical with a fluid and emergent structure. Participatory democratic action and consensus-building are key goals of the processes happening within the Org. The Org as a whole is the source of ultimate decision-making authority within Quorum1.

The Org contains sub-groups called quorums, some designated as core quorums. Each quorum is led by a single “point” member, and potentially also by a “triad” of three members.

The Org is led by the Core Points (the points from each core quorum), and by the Org Point. Points are considered leaders but not executives, in that they do not hold specific executive authority. The triad members may have executive authority.

The Org has four levels of membership, listed in increasing levels of commitment and trust:

- **Network members** create user accounts in Quorum1’s app suite and agree to our terms of service, but make no specific commitments to engagement level and have limited access to our systems.
- **Community members** commit to a certain level of engagement and make lightweight agreements around collaboration and sharing. They are given increased but still limited access to our systems.
- **Contributor members** sign formal membership agreements and are able to participate in paid projects and make significant contributions. They are given full end user level access to most systems, though administrative permissions and systems are granted based on other criteria.
- **Partner members** sign formal partnership agreements and are owning members of Quorum1’s underlying legal entity. They have the highest level of end user level systems access.

## The Platform

The Platform is a term for referring to, in its totality, the infrastructure needed to support the continued thriving operation of Quorum1 as a whole.

## The Foundation

The Foundation is a set of executive-led teams which exists in order to maintain and improve the Platform.

The leadership, structure, and mandate of the Foundation is ultimately managed by the Org via its participatory democratic processes. The Foundation also aspires to be participatory and democratic, but with a greater focus on operational stability, safety, security, reliability, and predictability.

The Foundation is made up of executive-led teams which may change over time, but which must include the following:

- Team Finance is responsible for Quorum1’s financial operations
- Team Legal is responsible for Quorum1’s legal operations and compliance
- Team Ops is responsible for Quorum1’s business and technical operations
- Team Build is responsible for building and maintaining Quorum1’s core technology

The Foundation is led by the Managing Partners, a group of up to three members. The Managing Partners are considered leaders and executives and hold executive authority over the Foundation, but ultimately serve at the behest of the Org as a whole.

## Hosted Entities

The Platform also serves to host other “virtual” business entities which exist in order support entrepreneurial innovation and revenue generation. These Hosted Entities operate with a high degree of financial and creative autonomy and contribute financial support back to the Org and the Foundation.

The types of hosted entities are listed below. The process for creating, changing, and retiring hosted entities is defined by the [Hosted Entity Management Process](#hosted-entity-management-process). Hosted entities will be established as separate legal entities as needed.

Each hosted entity is also considered a quorum, has a triad and a point, and is able to define its own governance process.

### Types of Hosted Entities

- A **Line of Business** is a simple type of Hosted Entity intended primarily to manage a set of service offerings made under the Quorum1 brand or another brand (an “alt-brand”, described in the next section).
- A **Virtual Company** is a more complex type of Hosted Entity intended to support a wide range of entrepreneurial activities, including product development, professional services, marketplaces, paid memberships, investment, shared ownership, and more.

### Key Properties of Hosted Entities

- **Entity Ledger:** All hosted entities have their own ledgers, usually a pass-through ledger. The ledger is managed and governed as defined by the hosted entity.
- **Brand:** A hosted entity is “Q1-branded” if it operates under the Quorum1 brand, or “alt-branded” if it operates under its own brand.
- **Investment:** A hosted entity is said to be “investable” if it is able to receive investment. Investable entities must have their own rev share ledger.
- **IP Bucket:** Some hosted entities have a collection of IP containing original inventions, ideas, processes, designs, copyrights, and patents.
- **Ownership Agreement:** Some hosted entities have an agreement outlining the guidelines for how ownership will be allocated if the hosted entity is ever spun out into a separate legal entity.

### Property by Hosted Entity Type

Almost all of the properties are mandatory for a virtual company. Lines of Business are comparatively simpler and more limited.

| Hosted Entity Type | Ledger? | Brand? | Investable? | IP Bucket? | Ownership Agreement? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Line of Business | ✅ | Optional | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Virtual Company | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
