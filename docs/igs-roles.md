# Informal Governance Structure Definition & Roles

This doc defines what Quorum1's Informal Governance Structure is, how it relates to our Formal Governance Structure, and what key roles are involved.

## Note on Informal Governance Structure

Quorum1 is currently operating in our "Informal Governance Structure" (IGS). 

There is a deadline to adopt our "Formal Governance Structure" (FGS) by December 31, 2025. The FGS will be a major release building on the ideation and design work which has been happening since before Quorum1's founding. FGS will be highly participatory, highly stigmergic, and designed to facilitate the continuing innovation and evolution of Quorum1 well into the future.

We have set a high bar for FGS and will utilize the diverse expertise and resources available to Quorum1 to create the best governance structure we possibly can. The quality of that work is key to our future success as an organization.

While we're in IGS we are purposely keeping certain parts of our structure simple. We are leaning on simpler, more centralized trust structures in the place of more complex participatory structures. The broad inspiration for IGS is the "chief maintainer" (or "strong steward") approach sometimes seen within open source communities. This approach utilizes a single highly-trusted individual with the authority to veto any changes, but not the authority to unilaterally enact changes.

During IGS our focus is on creating simple, efficient, clearly-defined structures that are able to support our efforts to make it to FGS successfully.

## Governance Roles

This section defines key roles within IGS. These may be referenced as dependencies in other docs and flows.

### Member

**Members** are all active Quorum1 members at any membership level. 

### Network Member

**Network Members** are all active members at the Network level of membership. They receive base access to select systems and do not have any formal role in governance. 

### Contributor

**Contributors** are all active members at the Contributor, Foundation, or Steward levels of membership. All contributors are able to participate in governance. To be clear: For the purposes of role definitions, Foundation Members and Stewards may also act as Contributors.

### Foundation Member

**Foundation Members** are all active members at the Foundation level of membership. They do not have any specific role in governance beyond their roles as Contributors.

### Steward

The **Stewards** are all active members at the Steward level of membership. They are also the owning "Members" of Quorum1's underlying legal entity and thus hold an increased level of responsibility and liability for the ongoing operation of Quorum1. The Stewards provide critical leadership in governance.

### Managing Steward

The **Managing Steward** (also referred to as the "Managing Partner") is a single individual, specifically Hank Holiday (also referred to as the Meta Founder).

If the Managing Steward is incapacitated such that they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, or if the Managing Steward no longer wishes to serve in the role, a new Managing Steward may be appointed with the unanimous approval of all Stewards capable of participating. In that event, this doc must be updated with the new Managing Steward's name.

### Signatory

While the Collective is in Informal Governance Structure only the Signatories specified in this section are able to bind the collective legally.

The Signatories are, specifically and exclusively: Hank Holiday (Q0001), Jay Kilian (Q0002), and Esteban Montero (Q0022).
