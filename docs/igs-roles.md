# Informal Governance Structure Definition & Roles

This doc defines what Quorum1's Informal Governance Structure is, how it relates to our Formal Governance Structure, and what key roles are involved.

## Note on Informal Governance Structure

Quorum1 is currently operating in our "Informal Governance Structure" (IGS). 

There is a deadline to adopt our "Formal Governance Structure" (FGS) by December 31, 2025. The FGS will be a major release building on the ideation and design work which has been happening since before Quorum1's founding. FGS will be highly participatory, highly stigmergic, and designed to facilitate the continuing innovation and evolution of Quorum1 well into the future.

We have set a high bar for FGS and will utilize the diverse expertise and resources available to Quorum1 to create the best governance structure we possibly can. The quality of that work is key to our future success as an organization.

While we're in IGS we are purposely keeping certain parts of our structure simple. We are leaning on simpler, more centralized trust structures in the place of more complex participatory structures. The broad inspiration for IGS is the "chief maintainer" (or "strong steward") approach sometimes seen within open source communities. This approach utilizes a single highly-trusted individual with the authority to veto any changes, but not the authority to unilaterally enact changes.

During IGS our focus is on creating simple, efficient, clearly-defined structures that are able to support our efforts to make it to FGS successfully.

## Governance Roles

This section defines key roles within IGS. These may be referenced as dependencies in other docs and flows.

### Member

**Members** are all active Quorum1 members at any membership level. 

### Network

**Network Members** or **The Network** refers to active members who participate in the community but have yet to collaborate on internal or external projects. They receive base access to select systems and do not have any formal role in governance. 

### Contributor

**Contributors** sign formal membership agreements and actively work on Foundation teams such as Finance, Ops, Build, and Legal. Stewards lead these teams and associated iniatives, and Contributors may also be invited to collaborate in these same areas.

### Foundation 

**Foundation members** sign formal membership agreements and actively work on Foundation teams such as Finance, Ops, Build, and Legal. Stewards lead these teams and associated iniatives, and Contributors may also be invited to collaborate in these same areas. 

### Stewards

The **Stewards** are active owning members of Quorum1's underlying legal entity and lead efforts and initiatives within The Foundation. 

### Strong Steward

The **Strong Steward** is a single individual, specifically Hank Holiday (also referred to as the Meta Founder).

If the Strong Steward is incapacitated such that they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, or if the Steward no longer wishes to serve in the role, a new Steward may be appointed with the unanimous approval of all Partners capable of participating. In that event, this doc should be updated with the new Steward's name.
