# Informal Governance Model Definition & Roles

_**Dependencies:** None_

This doc defines what Quorum1's Informal Governance Processes is, how it relates to our Formal Governance Process, and what key roles are involved.

## Note on Informal Governance Model

Quorum1 is currently operating in our "Informal Governance Model" (IGM). 

There is a deadline to adopt our "Formal Governance Model" (FGM) by December 31, 2025. The FGM will be a major release building on the ideation and design work which has been happening since before Quorum1's founding. FGM will be highly participatory, highly stigmergic, and designed to facilitate the continuing innovation and evolution of Quorum1 well into the future.

We have set a high bar for FGM and will utilize the diverse expertise and resources available to Quorum1 to create the best governance structure we possibly can. The quality of that work is key to our future success as an organization.

While we're in IGM we are purposely keeping certain parts of our structure simple. We are leaning on simpler, more centralized trust structures in the place of more complex participatory structures. The broad inspiration for IGM is the "chief maintainer" (or "strong steward") approach sometimes seen within open source communities. This approach utilizes a single highly-trusted individual with the authority to veto any changes, but not the authority to unilaterally enact changes.

During IGM our focus is on creating simple, efficient, clearly-defined structures that are able to support our efforts to make it to FGM successfully.

## Governance Roles

This section defines key roles within IGM. These may be referenced as dependencies in other docs and flows.

### Member

**Members** are all active Quorum1 members at any membership level.

### Contributor

**Contributors** are all active Quorum1 members at the "Contributor" or "Partner" membership level. To be clear: For the purposes of role definitions, Partners may also act as Contributors.

### Partner

**Partners** are active Quorum1 members at the "Partner" level of membership.

### Chief Maintainer

The **Chief Maintainer** is a single individual, specifically Hank Holiday (also referred to as the Meta Founder).

If the Chief Maintainer is incapacitated such that they are unable to fulfill their responsibilities effectively, or if the Chief Maintainer no longer wishes to serve in the role, a new Chief Maintainer may be appointed with the unanimous approval of all Partners capable of participating. In that event, this doc should be updated with the new Chief Maintainer's name.
